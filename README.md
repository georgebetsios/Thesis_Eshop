## üìù Developer's Note

This was my first experience with web development, having previously worked mainly with C++. As a result, the project structure may not follow best practices or clean architecture standards. However, the focus of this project was to explore the full development cycle of a web application ‚Äî from backend and frontend logic to database integration and dynamic content loading ‚Äî and to demonstrate functional features such as authentication, cart management, and email-based PDF invoicing.

Going forward, I'm committed to improving my code organization, implementing design patterns, and following industry-standard development practices.
